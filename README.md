The project is a basic HTML website, used for simulating an online courseware and textbook store. The site features dedicated pages for different engineering departments that can be used for browsing relevant materials. The website includes a product catalogue page listing books along with details and providing an "Add to cart" button, and a specific department page, CSE, which allows users to select a book from a dropdown and specify a quantity. User management through separate forms is incorporated into the site for login and registration. It then concludes the transaction flow with an Order Confirmation page.
